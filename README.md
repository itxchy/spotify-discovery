# Spotify Discovery

A React application to discover your favorite artists' albums on Spotify!

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.

You can search for artists to get a list of albums along with album details like cover art, a tracklist with song durations, and an album release date.

# Live Demo

A demo is available at [https://spotify.matttrifilo.com](https://spotify.matttrifilo.com).

# Quick Start

## Production

You can serve the `build` folder from a server.

## Development

`yarn` or `npm install` will install the dependencies.

`yarn start` or `npm start` will launch the development server.

## Thank you for the opportunity!

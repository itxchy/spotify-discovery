# Spotify Discovery

Find your next favorite record with help from Spotify's API! 

You can search for artists, and get a list of their albums and tracks which will lead you to the music itself.

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, and was coded using Semistandard style.

# [Live Demo](https://intense-dusk-18548.herokuapp.com/)

Give this a test drive on Heroku right [here](https://intense-dusk-18548.herokuapp.com/). 

> It may take a moment for the dyno to wake up. Heroku's free servers sleep after 30 minutes without traffic.

# Quick Start

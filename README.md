# Spotify Discovery

A React application to discover your favorite artists' albums on Spotify!

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.

You can search for artists to get a list of albums along with album details like cover art, a tracklist with song durations, and an album release date.

# Quick Start

## Production

You can serve the `build` folder from a server.

## Development

`yarn` or `npm install` will install the dependencies.

`npm start` will launch the development server.

`npm run watch-sass` will compile sass files into css files on every sass file change.

`npm run build-css` will compile all of the sass files into css files and output each one into the same directory as its source sass file.
